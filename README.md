Yelp is the fun and easy way to find, review and talk about what's great - and not so great - in your local area. It's about real people giving their honest and personal opinions on everything from restaurants and spas to coffee shops and bars. Our project focuses on analyses of the yelp data and producing meaningful insights from this data. The main goal of our project is to represent this data in a visually appealing way so as to communicate information clearly and effectively. Effective data visualization are capable and powerful at conveying knowledge more effective than tables or text. We present the data for the city of Las Vegas graphically, so that a user can land in a right place of his choice! We provide him with the necessary details about the place like price, open hours, reviews, etc. We hope to help him with our analysis.
